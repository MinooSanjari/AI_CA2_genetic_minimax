This is a University project for AI course. in this project, we focused on two search and optimization algorithms through two distinct problems:
1) Solving a jigsaw puzzle using Genetic Algorithm and performing optimizations on our search.
2) An intelligent agent playing a Dots and Boxes game using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
